# Operator Profile Schema

**Operational summary:**
- Required files: `overview.md` (one-paragraph stance), `workflow_policy.md` (Frame→Decompose→Execute→Verify→Handoff stages + risk/autonomy policy + memory contract), `cognitive_profile.md` (core philosophy + decision protocol + red flags), `operator_profile.md` (scorecard).
- Scorecard axes (0–3): `planning_strictness`, `risk_tolerance`, `testing_rigor`, `parallelism_preference`, `documentation_rigor`, `automation_level`. Missing = unknown; filled = commitment.
- Authority hierarchy: project docs > operator profile > kernel defaults > runtime defaults.
- A profile must *distinguish* this operator from defaults. Generic best-practice = failed profile.

---

An **operator profile** is the explicit encoding of a human operator's
cognitive preferences, reasoning posture, and working style. It is the file
the kernel reads to personalize orientation to a specific person, so every
session starts from a formed worldview rather than cold defaults.

This document defines the schema. The author's own instance lives at
`core/memory/global/` as a worked example.

---

## Why it is a schema, not a template

A template invites the user to fill in blanks. A schema requires them to
have an opinion.

Operator profiles fail when they read like generic best-practice advice. At
that point they contain nothing an agent did not already have by default.
The schema below forces each field to express a preference that
distinguishes this operator from the default.

---

## Required sections

### 1. `overview.md` — what is this operator optimizing for?

One paragraph. The highest-level frame: what is the operator's work, who
benefits from it, what does doing it well look like? This is the document
consulted when a lower-level preference is silent. It is the tiebreaker.

Must include the operator's core working stance in one sentence.
("Systems thinker with engineering precision" is a valid stance; "wants
good code" is not — it distinguishes nothing.)

### 2. `workflow_policy.md` — how should work proceed?

The procedural contract the agent must follow inside this operator's
projects. Required subsections:

- **Standard Flow** — named stages (for example: Frame → Decompose →
  Execute → Verify → Handoff) with one paragraph per stage describing what
  that stage produces.
- **Risk and Autonomy Policy** — which actions the agent may take without
  confirmation, which require a checkpoint. At minimum, name the
  reversible/irreversible threshold.
- **Project Memory Contract** — where authoritative project state lives
  (which files in `docs/`), and what lives in tool-native memory versus
  repo-committed docs.

### 3. `cognitive_profile.md` — how does this operator reason?

The epistemic layer. The operator's answer to: how do you decide what is
true, what is uncertain, what is a bet? Required subsections:

- **Core Philosophy** — three to five foundational rules (facts vs
  inferences separation, treatment of certainty, etc.). Opinionated, not
  generic.
- **Decision Protocol** — the numbered sequence the operator wants followed
  for non-trivial decisions. Must reference the Reasoning Surface and the
  Disconfirmation condition.
- **Cognitive Red Flags** — patterns that should make the agent *slow
  down*, not speed up. False urgency, solution-first framing, hidden
  assumptions, and similar.

### 4. `operator_profile.md` — deterministic working-style scorecard

A numeric scorecard (0–3 scale) across canonical axes, so adapters can make
non-contextual behavioral choices (whether to run tests by default, whether
to surface risk warnings, and so on):

| Axis                      | Meaning (0 → 3)                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `planning_strictness`     | ad-hoc → formal planning before any action   |
| `risk_tolerance`          | conservative → willing to take bigger swings |
| `testing_rigor`           | manual only → tests are gating before done   |
| `parallelism_preference`  | serial → many parallel lanes                 |
| `documentation_rigor`     | code-only → docs-first contract each session |
| `automation_level`        | bash one-liners → heavy automated workflows  |

A missing axis means "unknown." A filled-in axis is a commitment.

**Required metadata (v0.10.0+):** the file MUST carry a
`Last elicited: YYYY-MM-DD` line near the top. The sync path parses it and
injects a visible "Stale Context Warning" into the rendered operator memory
whenever the date is absent or older than 30 days. Priorities and risk
tolerances drift; the warning exists so an agent does not silently act on
stale posture. Form accepted by the parser:
`Last elicited: 2026-04-20`, `_Last elicited: 2026-04-20_`,
`- Last elicited: 2026-04-20`.

---

## Optional but recommended

### `python_runtime_policy.md` (or equivalent toolchain policy)

Machine-specific constraints an agent would otherwise guess wrong about:
which Python, which package manager, which shell, which editor. One line
per constraint. Machine-generated content goes here if it would otherwise
leak into portable docs.

### Domain-specific policy files

For domains with hard rules (regulated code, data handling constraints,
etc.), add a dedicated file rather than mixing it into
`workflow_policy.md`. Each domain file should be loadable independently.

---

## Authority hierarchy

When rules conflict, the kernel resolves in this order, most specific
wins:

1. Project-level docs (`docs/*.md` inside a specific repo)
2. Operator profile (the files defined in this schema)
3. Kernel defaults (this repository's kernel)
4. Runtime defaults (whatever Claude Code, Hermes, etc. ship with)

The hierarchy is itself a consequence of Principle I: the most specific
explicit truth wins over general defaults.

---

## How adapters consume the profile

Adapters mount the profile files into the runtime's context-loading
mechanism without transforming their content:

- Claude Code: referenced from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` as managed-region
  imports.
- Hermes: written to `~/.hermes/OPERATOR.md` as a managed region.
- Any future runtime: same files, same content, different destination.

If an adapter needs to *transform* the profile to fit a runtime, that is a
sign the kernel's portability is leaking. The profile schema should be
stable enough that no adapter needs to edit it.

---

## Validation

A well-formed profile should:

- Have a stated preference on every required scorecard axis.
- State the Core Question and Reasoning Surface protocol in
  `cognitive_profile.md` so orientation inherits them.
- Define the authority hierarchy for the operator's project docs.
- Contain nothing that could be derived from reading the operator's code.
  Project structure and conventions are properties of projects, not of
  operators.

A profile that fails any of these is probably not personalizing anything.
It is a generic best-practices document with the operator's name on it.
