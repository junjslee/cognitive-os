# Verification — Attribution Audit

Verify step of the loop: did the execution produce what the Frame
promised? Each Knowns / Assumptions claim is re-checked against the
post-execution state.

## Against the Core Question

*"Are the concepts load-bearing the cognitive-os kernel attributed to
their primary sources?"*

**Yes, within scope.** Every concept identified in
`decision-trace.md`'s load-bearing table now has a primary-source entry
in `kernel/REFERENCES.md` with a concept-to-kernel-wording cross
reference. Each relevant kernel file now ends with an "Attribution"
section that names the governing sources and points to REFERENCES.md
for detail.

**With one explicit residual.** The audit examined the kernel files as
they exist at time of audit. A future kernel edit could introduce a new
load-bearing borrow without corresponding attribution. The
`HOOKS_MAP.md` or an equivalent doctor check could surface this
regression automatically; it does not yet. Logged in handoff.md.

## Against the Assumptions

| Assumption                                                                                     | Verified?                                                                                                           | Status    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| The operator's goal is honest intellectual lineage, not a shorter file.                        | Operator's explicit request: "add ten references, and also add all mentioned that are worth being added."            | **Held**  |
| Ten primary citations is the right magnitude.                                                  | Count audited: ten added (Popper, Shannon, Argyris/Schön, Alexander, Polanyi, Graham+Taleb, Pearl, Simon, Deming, Meadows), plus the four preserved (Kahneman/Munger/Boyd/Dalio). Fourteen primary total. No load-bearing concept identified remained unattributed. | **Held**  |
| Inline "See also" lines at section ends are the correct attribution form.                      | Applied to CONSTITUTION.md, REASONING_SURFACE.md, FAILURE_MODES.md, KERNEL_LIMITS.md. Footer length: 5–8 lines each. Signal preserved; clutter subjectively minimal. | **Provisional — reader judgment pending** |

## Against the Disconfirmation list

Each disconfirmation condition from `reasoning-surface.json` re-checked.

### D1 — "A concept remains in kernel wording that is clearly not original AND not attributed"

**Not triggered.** A concept-by-concept walk of CONSTITUTION.md,
REASONING_SURFACE.md, FAILURE_MODES.md, and KERNEL_LIMITS.md locates each
load-bearing borrow in REFERENCES.md. The audit is not a proof of
completeness (a future review may find one more), but no such concept
was identified in this pass.

### D2 — "The kernel claims universal applicability without naming boundary conditions"

**Closed.** `kernel/KERNEL_LIMITS.md` now names six conditions under which
the kernel is the wrong tool, plus four structural gaps the kernel does
not yet close. CONSTITUTION.md's "what it is not" section now links to
KERNEL_LIMITS.md.

### D3 — "REFERENCES.md entries list sources without specifying which kernel wording they informed"

**Closed.** Each primary entry in REFERENCES.md includes a
concept-to-kernel-wording table showing which specific kernel phrasing
the source governs, and a cross-reference to the kernel file that hosts
that phrasing.

---

## What changed vs what held

- **Changed.** `kernel/REFERENCES.md` went from four attribution entries
  to fourteen primary + ~15 secondary, each with traceable
  concept-to-wording mapping.
- **Changed.** `kernel/KERNEL_LIMITS.md` did not exist; now declares six
  named failure conditions and four structural gaps.
- **Changed.** `kernel/CONSTITUTION.md`, `REASONING_SURFACE.md`,
  `FAILURE_MODES.md` now carry inline Attribution footers.
- **Held.** The four principles themselves. The six failure modes. The
  Reasoning Surface four-field structure. The workflow loop. No
  principle was softened, renamed, or reframed — the audit was about
  lineage, not content.

## Residual unknowns surfaced by verification

1. Whether the inline pointers will be maintained as the kernel evolves,
   or will drift out of sync with REFERENCES.md over time. Mitigated by
   using keyword-level names instead of full citations inline.
2. Whether the secondary list (Dewey, Senge, Edmondson, et al.) is
   itself load-bearing in any subtle way that was missed. Marked as a
   soft risk; no specific concept identified.
3. Whether KERNEL_LIMITS.md's six conditions exhaust the meaningful
   boundary of the kernel, or are the ones visible at the current scale.
   The file is explicitly a v1 of a stance, not an exhaustive taxonomy.

These are logged in handoff.md as the carried-forward debt.

## Hypothesis evaluation

**Stated hypothesis** (from `reasoning-surface.json`):
> The kernel currently honors attribution for a minority of its
> load-bearing borrows and is silent on at least ten more. Adding those
> with inline pointers will materially improve the repo's intellectual
> honesty without bloating the kernel files.

**Result:** validated within the scope of this cycle. Ten
previously-unattributed load-bearing borrows identified; all now
attributed; inline pointers kept at 5–8 lines per file; no principle or
protocol content displaced by the additions.

**Refinement for next cycle:** add a lightweight doctor check that flags
when a kernel file grows a new concept without a corresponding
REFERENCES.md entry. Without it, the attribution audit is a point-in-time
snapshot, not a durable property.
