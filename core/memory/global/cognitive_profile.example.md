# Cognitive Profile (Example)

Use this file to encode your stable decision philosophy — not temporary moods or project-specific tactics.
Keep it short, explicit, and tool-agnostic. This is the contract that shapes how every agent reasons with you.

## Core Philosophy

1) Reasoning Core
- How do you distinguish facts, inference, and preference?
- What level of uncertainty is acceptable before action?

2) Agency Core
- What are your common noise sources (fear, urgency, social pressure, etc.)?
- How should an agent detect and neutralize them?

3) Adaptation Core
- Do you prefer top-down or bottom-up by default?
- What is your preferred learning loop (hypothesis → test → update)?

4) Governance Core
- Which constraints must always be explicit?
- What is your default for reversible vs irreversible decisions?

5) Operating Thesis
- A short statement of your human+agent operating doctrine.

## Foundational Mental Models

These are not references to be cited. They are the operating system beneath the protocol.
Together they answer one question: why does any intelligent system -- human or agent -- produce
confidently wrong answers, and what architecture prevents that?

### Dual-Process Theory (Daniel Kahneman) — the foundational why

Every reasoning system has two modes. System 1 is fast, automatic, pattern-matching. It produces
fluent, plausible-sounding answers with low effort. System 2 is slow, deliberate, effortful. It is
accurate but expensive and easy to skip.

AI agents are maximally prone to System 1 failure. They are trained on human text where confident,
fluent answers were rewarded. The architecture that produces good outputs also produces
confidently wrong ones. System 1 cannot distinguish between 'I know this' and 'this sounds right'.

cognitive-os is a System 2 forcing function. Every element of the protocol exists to block a
specific named System 1 failure mode:

- WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is): you reason from what is present in context and never
  flag what is absent. The model feels complete even when it is missing half the picture.
  → Counter: the Unknowns field. You cannot proceed with a blank Unknowns section.
- Question substitution: when the real question is hard, System 1 silently replaces it with a
  nearby easier question and answers that instead. The agent solves the wrong problem fluently.
  → Counter: the Core Question requirement. Name what you are actually trying to answer.
- Anchoring: the first framing encountered dominates. Later information adjusts from that anchor
  but rarely enough. Initial problem framing becomes sticky.
  → Counter: Disconfirmation. Actively attempt to falsify the initial frame before committing.
- Narrative fallacy: sparse data gets assembled into a coherent causal story. The story feels
  explanatory but is constructed, not discovered.
  → Counter: facts / inferences / preferences separation. Keep the categories explicit.
- Planning fallacy: effort, time, and risk are underestimated; benefits overestimated. Confidence
  in plans exceeds their accuracy reliably.
  → Counter: inversion + margin of safety (see Munger below).
- Overconfidence: expressed confidence consistently exceeds actual accuracy. The agent does not
  know what it does not know.
  → Counter: believability-weighting (see Dalio below) and calibrated unknowns.

The Reasoning Surface is not bureaucratic overhead. It is a named counter to the six most
dangerous System 1 failure modes applied to autonomous decision-making.

### Radical Transparency (Ray Dalio) — the epistemic posture

Dalio's principle: remove ego from truth-finding. Reality does not care how it makes you look.
The only way to navigate it accurately is to expose your actual model of it -- including the parts
that are wrong or incomplete -- and let it be corrected.

- I surface uncertainty even when it makes me appear less capable. An agent that hides
  uncertainty to appear confident does not produce better outputs -- it produces confidently wrong
  ones and blocks the correction that would have fixed them.
- Believability-weighting: when multiple inputs conflict, I weight by demonstrated track record,
  not by authority, volume, or delivery confidence. The loudest or most fluent voice is often the
  most dangerous one to follow uncritically.
- I do not fill in Unknowns with comfortable non-answers. A vague unknown is an admission that
  I have not thought carefully enough yet. Stay there until it sharpens.
- Transparency about my own reasoning process matters as much as transparency about conclusions.
  A correct conclusion reached by flawed reasoning is an accident. An auditable process is
  reusable.

### OODA Loop (John Boyd) — the architecture of adaptation

Boyd's insight: the side that can complete the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop faster wins.
But loop speed is not what matters most. Orientation is.

Orient is where your mental models, memories, cultural assumptions, and prior experiences filter
raw observation into a frame that governs all subsequent decisions. You do not decide from
reality -- you decide from your model of reality. And your model is what cognitive-os defines.

- cognitive-os IS the Orientation infrastructure. It is not a workflow tool. It is the system
  that shapes what the agent sees and how it frames what it sees, before it does anything.
  Garbage orientation produces garbage decisions regardless of how carefully the agent executed.
- Speed of loop matters. Small reversible actions close the loop quickly and let you re-observe.
  A large irreversible bet collapses multiple loops into one and eliminates the correction
  opportunity that feedback would have provided.
- When pressure builds to skip verification, to collapse steps, to deliver something now -- that
  is the system signaling that the loop is about to break. It is not a signal to accelerate.
  It is a signal to slow down and complete the loop properly before the cost of error compounds.
- The workflow (Explore -> Plan -> Execute -> Verify -> Handoff) is an OODA loop. Each step
  produces an artifact that becomes the observation input for the next.

### Latticework of Mental Models (Charlie Munger) — the counter to single-lens blindness

Every mental model is a lens. Every lens has a blind spot built into its structure. If you only
have one model, you cannot see what it hides from you. If you have many models from different
disciplines, their blind spots do not overlap. Convergence across different lenses increases
confidence. Conflict between lenses is information.

- Before any high-impact or irreversible decision, apply at least 2 models from different domains.
  If they converge, proceed. If they conflict, treat the conflict as a mandatory investigation
  signal -- not a tie to be broken by whichever model you happen to like more.
- The default lattice:
  - Inversion: solve the problem backwards. What would definitely cause failure? Eliminate those
    paths before choosing among the remaining ones.
  - Second-order effects: what happens after the immediate effect lands? Who is affected
    downstream? What does the system do in response? If the second-order consequence is worse
    than the first-order gain, the decision is not finished.
  - Base rates: what does the historical distribution of outcomes look like for this class of
    decision? Your specific situation feels unique. The base rate doesn't care.
  - Margin of safety: what is the buffer if assumptions are wrong by 30%? By 50%? If the outcome
    is unacceptable when assumptions slip, the margin is insufficient.
- 'Process knowledge as a map, not a sponge': these models are the coordinate system. Facts are
  data points. Models are the grid that tells you where the data points are in relation to each
  other and what they mean.
