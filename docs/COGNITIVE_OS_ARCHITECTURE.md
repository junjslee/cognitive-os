# cognitive-os Architecture

## Purpose

`cognitive-os` is the cognitive + execution operating system for cross-project development and research workflows. It operationalizes decision quality, memory governance, execution cognition, and accountable evolution.

Distributed via the `cognitive-os` CLI/package.

It provides:
- stable memory outside chat sessions
- reusable skills and workflow policy
- tool-specific adapters for Claude Code, Codex, opencode, and Hermes
- bounded execution patterns: worktrees, review gates, and handoffs

It is not:
- a project requirements document
- a plugin marketplace
- a replacement for repo-local project truth

## Positioning

cognitive-os is the governance and identity layer that sits above agent platforms. The platforms are delivery vessels; cognitive-os is the authority.

- cognitive-os lives above Claude Code, Codex, opencode, and Hermes. Those tools are adapters -- they consume the cognitive contract but do not define it.
- No single agent platform is authoritative. cognitive-os is. A context reset in Claude Code, a new Codex session, or a Cursor workspace change does not reset your identity -- only cognitive-os holds that.
- The layer distinction matters: agent platforms handle execution (run code, call tools, respond in sessions). cognitive-os handles governance (who the agent is, what it knows, how it behaves, what it remembers across sessions and tools).
- Sync flows one direction: from cognitive-os outward to platforms. Platforms do not write back into cognitive-os automatically; durable lessons are explicitly promoted via `cognitive-os evolve` or manual authoring.
- This architecture makes cognitive-os portable across the current toolchain and any future tools -- a new adapter can be added without changing the identity layer.

## 🧬 Layer Model: The Soul and the Vessel

The system separates **Cognition** from **Execution** deliberately. They reinforce each other — cognition without execution is theory; execution without cognition is a brittle machine.

### 🏛️ Cognitive Layer (The Soul)

Defines how the agent thinks and reasons.
- **Identity**: Who the agent is — professional profile, cognitive style, reasoning posture.
- **First Principles**: Foundational reasoning laws — epistemic humility, disconfirmation discipline.
- **Governance**: Decision-making limits and ethical boundaries.

### 🛠️ Execution Layer (The Vessel)

Defines how the agent acts and adapts.
- **Workflow**: The stages of transformation — Explore → Plan → Manifest.
- **Harnesses**: Project-type-specific operating environments — execution profiles, constraints, safety notes.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Deterministic quality enforcement — post-write formatting, pre-commit tests, stop-gate checks.

### 1. Global cognitive-os

Source of truth for:
- personal workflow policy
- safety defaults
- shared skills
- shared subagent definitions
- repo templates
- harness definitions
- sync and bootstrap scripts

### 2. Project Harness

A harness defines the operating environment for a specific project type.
Provisioned once at project creation (or applied to an existing project) and lives as `HARNESS.md` in the project root.

A harness specifies:
- execution profile (`local`, `remote_gpu`, etc.)
- workflow constraints and safety notes specific to the domain
- recommended agents and skills
- extensions to `docs/RUN_CONTEXT.md`

Available harness types: `ml-research`, `python-library`, `web-app`, `data-pipeline`, `generic`.
Add custom types by dropping a JSON file into `core/harnesses/`.

Detection: `cognitive-os detect [path]` scores signals in the repo (dependency files, file patterns, directory names) and recommends the best match.

### 3. Project Memory

Every project keeps its definitive truth in repo files:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `docs/PLAN.md`
- `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- `docs/RUN_CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

This layer must remain tool-agnostic.

### 4. Tool Adapters

Tool-specific runtime files shape behavior without replacing project memory.

Current adapters:
- Claude:
  `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, hooks, plugins, and project-local agents if needed
- Codex:
  `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml`, repo or global skills, and project-local agents if needed
- opencode:
  `~/.config/opencode/agents/cognitive-os-governance.md` (global governance subagent),
  `AGENTS.md` (per-project behavioral contract, same file Codex reads)
- Hermes:
  `~/.hermes/OPERATOR.md` (synced composite), `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` (auto-created on first sync),
  `~/.hermes/skills/` (managed skills)
- OMO / OMX (Oh-My-OpenAgent / Oh-My-Codex):
  Syncs shared skills, agent personas, and structural governance policy to `~/.omo` or `~/.omx`

### 5. Managed Runtime Bridges (additive)

Managed runtimes (for example Anthropic Managed Agents) are execution substrates that emit durable event logs.
`cognitive-os` ingests those events through bridge commands and converts them into Memory Contract envelopes.

Current bridge:
- `cognitive-os bridge anthropic-managed --input <events.json>`
  - outputs `memory-contract-v1` envelopes under `core/memory/bridges/anthropic-managed/`
  - does not modify existing adapter sync behavior

### 6. Optional Plugin or Service Layer

This layer is optional and non-authoritative.

Examples:
- Claude-only plugins such as `claude-mem`
- MCP servers
- Codex-side memory tooling

These additions may accelerate work but must never become the only place where project truth lives.

## Source of Truth Order

When layers disagree, this order wins:
1. Repo requirements and execution docs
2. Repo runtime files
3. Global `cognitive-os` defaults
4. Optional plugins or memory services

Plugins and local memory services are helpers, not authorities.

## Memory Model

The memory model is split on purpose.

`cognitive-os profile` adds a deterministic onboarding layer that generates explainable scorecards and compiles workflow policy from explicit rules. Generated artifacts live under `core/memory/global/.generated/` and remain non-authoritative until compiled to global memory markdown (`--write`). Survey-driven modes also support non-interactive `--answers-file` JSON input.

`cognitive-os cognition` adds a deterministic cognitive layer for philosophy, decision attitude, and thinking posture. It supports survey, infer, and hybrid modes, and compiles into `cognitive_profile.md` when requested.

### Memory Contract v1

For portable integrations and deterministic reconciliation, see:
- Spec: `docs/MEMORY_CONTRACT.md`
- Schemas: `core/schemas/memory-contract/*.json`

Contract highlights:
- explicit classes: global, project, episodic
- required provenance metadata for trust/audit
- deterministic conflict semantics with human override precedence

### Evolution Contract v1

For safe, auditable self-improvement, see:
- Spec: `docs/EVOLUTION_CONTRACT.md`
- Schemas: `core/schemas/evolution/*.json`

Contract highlights:
- generator/critic role split
- bounded mutation library
- deterministic replay + promotion gates
- human-approved promotion with rollback linkage

### Global Memory

Put stable, cross-project information here:
- operator preferences
- naming conventions
- safety policy
- runtime policy
- cross-project workflow defaults

### Project Memory

Put project-specific truth here:
- what is being built
- current milestone
- current blockers
- execution constraints
- accepted decisions
- next handoff

### Plugin Memory

Treat plugin-managed memory as a cache or retrieval layer, not as the authoritative record.

If a plugin retrieves something important enough to matter later, write it back into repo docs or the relevant global memory file.

## Tool Matrix

### Claude
Strengths:
- hooks
- plugins
- MCP
- project and local settings scopes
- built-in worktree support

Use Claude when you want:
- lifecycle hooks
- plugin-backed enhancements
- deeper Claude-native orchestration

### Codex
Strengths:
- strong repo instruction handling through `AGENTS.md`
- repo-local config
- global and repo skills
- project-local agents

Use Codex when you want:
- Codex-first implementation work
- direct use inside Codex CLI or IDE surfaces
- the same shared repo memory with lighter tool-specific overhead

### opencode
Strengths:
- open-source, provider-agnostic (Claude, OpenAI, local models)
- TUI-first, built by terminal power users
- AGENTS.md-compatible (same contract as Codex)
- strong multi-agent / subagent support via @agent-name invocation

cognitive-os syncs a global governance subagent to `~/.config/opencode/agents/`.
Per-project contract is AGENTS.md, same as Codex. No per-project adapter file needed.

## Execution Model

The standard execution pattern:
1. Explore
2. Plan
3. Implement
4. Review
5. Handoff

The standard scaling pattern:
- one bounded objective per worktree
- one active owner per worktree
- review gate before merge

The standard automation boundary:
- allow bounded loops for clearly defined search or evaluation tasks
- block unattended destructive changes, auto-merge, and uncontrolled code-writing loops

## Safety and Governance

- Keep credentials, auth state, and machine-specific overrides local.
- Keep shared workflow docs and reproducible runtime files in Git.
- Use Conventional Commits.
- Prefer review gates for risky code or schema changes.
- Keep local Python-backed `cognitive-os` work on Conda `base`.

## Plugin Integration Policy

Before adding a plugin or memory layer, verify:
1. Is it cross-tool or Claude-only?
2. Does it replace authoritative docs, or only accelerate retrieval?
3. Can the project still operate without it?
4. Does it introduce a second source of truth?

### Optional adapters

`claude-mem` overlaps with `cognitive-os` only partially.

What `cognitive-os` already covers:
- explicit markdown memory
- handoff docs
- stable workflow policy
- cross-project and cross-tool structure

What `claude-mem` adds:
- automatic Claude-session capture
- retrieval of past Claude activity across sessions
- plugin-managed memory search

So `claude-mem` is a useful optional Claude layer, but it does not replace `cognitive-os`.

### Codex and `claude-mem`

`claude-mem` is Claude-specific. It should not be treated as a Codex memory solution.

For Codex, the current base is:
- shared repo docs
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- global and repo skills

If deeper Codex memory is needed later, add a Codex-native or tool-neutral layer rather than depending on a Claude-only plugin.

## Bootstrap and Sync

The workflow:
1. Edit `cognitive-os`
2. Run `cognitive-os sync`
3. Bootstrap new repos with `cognitive-os bootstrap`
4. Use worktrees and repo memory inside each project

## Non-Goals

- no automatic merge to `main`
- no plugin-specific lock-in as the base architecture
- no assumption that one tool's private memory is enough for team-visible project truth
