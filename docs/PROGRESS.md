## 0.7.0 — 2026-04-19

### Real enforcement pass
- `core/hooks/reasoning_surface_guard.py` — added `_write_audit()` writing structured entries to `~/.cognitive-os/audit.jsonl` on every check (passed / advisory / blocked)
- `src/cognitive_os/cli.py` — added `_inject()`, `_surface_log()`, parser registration, and dispatch for `inject` and `log` commands
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — version bumped to 0.6.0
- `kernel/CHANGELOG.md` — 0.7.0 entry added
- Verified: `cognitive-os inject /tmp` creates strict-surface + template; hook fires real exit-2 block; `cognitive-os log` shows timestamped audit entries

## 0.6.0 — 2026-04-19

### Gap closure (second pass)
- `kernel/CONSTITUTION.md` — added DbC contract paragraph to Principle I; added feedforward control paragraph to Principle IV; added feedforward + DbC bullets to "What this generates"
- `kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md` — added feedforward framing to intro; renamed review checklist to "pre-execution checklist" to make the feedforward intent explicit
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml` — added "Kernel alignment" field mapping bugs to failure modes and kernel layers
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — added "Kernel impact" checklist block
- `README.md` — replaced TODO comment with ASCII control-plane architecture diagram
- `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md` — created (ops docs were absent; hook advisory fired on every kernel edit)

### Initial pass
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — fixed `source: "."` → `"https://github.com/junjslee/cognitive-os"` (schema fix; unverified against live validator)
- `src/cognitive_os/viewer/index.html` — removed (deprecated UI artifact)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml` — added "Epistemic alignment" field; improved acceptance criteria template
- `README.md` — added governance/control-plane opening paragraph; feedforward + DbC + OPA framing in "Why this architecture"; "Zero-trust execution" section with OWASP counter-mapping table; "Human prompt debugging" section; interoperability statement; ASCII control-plane diagram
- `kernel/KERNEL_LIMITS.md` — added Cynefin problem-domain classification table
- `kernel/CHANGELOG.md` — added [0.6.0] entry
